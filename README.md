Here’s a polished **README.md** template for your GitHub project built around the “Apples‑Bananas‑Oranges” dataset from Kaggle:

# 🍎 Apples‑Bananas‑Oranges Fruit Classification Project

## Overview

This repository hosts a machine learning (ML) project that uses the **Apples‑Bananas‑Oranges** dataset from Kaggle to build a classifier distinguishing between apples, bananas, and oranges (fresh or otherwise). The goal is to experiment with various ML models (e.g., CNN, transfer learning, or classical ML) to accurately identify fruit type and freshness.

## Dataset

* Source: Kaggle dataset by **sriramr** (“Apples‑Bananas‑Oranges”) ([Kaggle][1])
* Contains images of three fruits: apples, bananas, and oranges. Dataset is often used in freshness / rotten classification tasks with six categories (fresh/rotten × three fruits) ([Kaggle][2]).
* Common splits:

  * \~13,500 total images across training and testing sets.
  * Variants seen in other forks: approx. 10k–11k training and \~2.6k testing images ([GitHub][3], [GitHub][4]).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Download the dataset:

  1. Visit Kaggle: \[Apples‑Bananas‑Oranges Dataset by sriramr]
  2. Download and unpack into `dataset/` folder, preserving train/test structure.

### Usage

#### 1. Explore the Data

Open `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` to analyze class distribution, sample images, and visual insights.

#### 2. Train a Model

Choose a notebook or script (e.g. `model_training.ipynb` or `src/model.py`) to build and train a classifier. Example architectures:

* CNN from scratch (baseline)
* Transfer learning (e.g., VGG16, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2—commonly used in similar projects ([GitHub][5], [GitHub][3]))

Configure hyperparameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate) and train.

#### 3. Evaluate and Visualize

* Use `evaluation.ipynb` to generate accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss curves.
* Store metrics in `results/metrics.csv`, and save sample predictions in `results/sample_predictions/`.

## ✅ Key Features

* **Multiple classifier approaches**: CNN, transfer learning, or other machine learning methods.
* **Train/Test splits**: properly separated for accurate evaluation.
* **Reproducible training pipeline**: scripts and notebooks provided.
* **Visualization tools**: visualize image samples, learning curves, and confusion matrices.
* **Configurable and extendable**: easy to adapt to other fruits or datasets.

## 📊 Results & Evaluation

Include a summary table of your performance results and comparisons here, for example:

| Model          | Accuracy (%) | Test Accuracy (%) | Comments           |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| CNN (scratch)  | 95%          | 92%               | Baseline           |
| VGG16 Transfer | 99%          | 98.3%             | Fine‑tuned model   |
| MobileNetV2    | 98%          | 97%               | Lightweight & fast |

*Note: Numbers are illustrative based on other implementations using this dataset ([GitHub][6]).*

## 🔧 Configuration

Parameters like learning rate, epochs, and batch size can be configured via `config.yaml` or editing the scripts directly.

## 📂 Project Roadmap & Extensions

* Add support for additional fruit types or more quality states.
* Explore newer model architectures (e.g. EfficientNet).
* Implement real‑time detection with mobile or edge deployment.
* Perform cross‑validation and augment data to increase robustness.
* Web or mobile app integration for live freshness detection.
